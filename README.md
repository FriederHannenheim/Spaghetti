# Spaghetti
Spaghetti is a minecraft mod that adds spaghetti which you can throw at people.

You can craft spaghetti using one wheat in the crafting grid. To cook the spaghetti you will need to drop it in a water-filled cauldron with a lit campfire underneath.
You can combine the spaghetti with Tomatos and Cheese to make it tastier.
